## Cli

We also provide a cli tool to interact with the API.

```bash

  help [command]                             display help for command
```

Or use it with docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/data" ghcr.io/not-three/cli --help
```

## Deployment

The simplest way to use !3 is to visit our hosted instance at [https://not-th.re](https://not-th.re).

### Micro

The micro deployment does not bring its own UI, but you can use the public UI.

```yml
services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/api:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      CORS_ENABLED: true
      LIMITS_DISABLED: true
      INSTANCE_PASSWORD: MySecretPassword
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    volumes:
      - db:/data/db

volumes:
  db:
```

After you have deployed the API, visit the [public UI](https://not-th.re)
go to `Tools` -> `Edit Settings` and update these values:

```json
{
  "customServer": {
    "url": "http://<ip-of-the-server>:4000/",
    "password": "MySecretPassword"
  }
}
```

Dont forget to save the settings, by clicking on `File` -> `Save` (or by pressing `ctrl` + `s`).

### Minimal

The minimal deployment includes the API and the UIs.
The UI has the proxy mode enabled, so you only need a single port.

```yml
x-restart: &restart
  restart: unless-stopped

services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/api:latest
    <<: *restart
    volumes:
      - db:/data/db

  draw:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/draw:latest
    <<: *restart

  ui:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/ui:latest
    <<: *restart
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    depends_on:
      - api
      - draw
    environment:
      PROXY_URL: http://api:3000
      DRAW_PROXY_URL: http://draw:80

volumes:
  db:
```

### Simple

An simple deployment, including a postgres database instead of sqlite.
Recommended if you want to store more than a few pastes.

```yml
x-restart: &restart
  restart: unless-stopped

services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/api:latest
    <<: *restart
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      CORS_ENABLED: true
      CORS_ORIGIN: http://localhost:4000
      DATABASE_MODE: pg
      DATABASE_HOST: db
      DATABASE_USERNAME: db
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: db
      DATABASE_NAME: db

  draw:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/draw:latest
    <<: *restart
    ports:
      - 4500:80

  ui:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/ui:latest
    <<: *restart
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    environment:
      API_URL: http://localhost:3000
      DRAW_URL: http://localhost:4500
      TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL: https://example.com

  db:
    image: postgres:14.5
    <<: *restart
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: db
      POSTGRES_USER: db
      POSTGRES_DB: db
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
```

### Advanced

See one of the following files for a more detailed example:

- [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)
- [docker-compose.swarm.yml](./docker-compose.swarm.yml)

These include horizontal scaling, health checks and traefik as a reverse proxy.

### Environment variables

For a full list, with detailed descriptions of all environment variables, see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.not-th.re).

### Helm

As of now, we do not have an official helm chart, if you want to contribute one, feel free to open a PR.

## Static site deployment

In some scenarios, you might want to deploy the static site without a backend,
for example [not-th.re](https://not-th.re) is deployed with Cloudflare Pages,
while the API is hosted on [api.not-th.re](https://api.not-th.re).

The static site can then be configured by editing the `config.json` file.

```json
{ "baseURL": "https://api.not-th.re/", "drawURL": "https://draw.not-th.re/", "termsURL": "https://scolasti.co/go/privacy" }
```

You can download the client bundle from one of the following sources:

### Github Releases

All stable versions of the client are available as a github release artifact.

[![download ui stable gh releases artifacts](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-UI_stable_gh_releases_artifacts-blue)](https://github.com/not-three/ui/releases)

[![download draw stable gh releases artifacts](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-DRAW_stable_gh_releases_artifacts-blue)](https://github.com/not-three/draw/releases)

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh -v $(pwd):/mnt ghcr.io/not-three/ui:latest -c "cp -r /app/public/ /mnt/ui/"

docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh -v $(pwd):/mnt ghcr.io/not-three/draw:latest -c "cp -r /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ /mnt/draw/"
```

This will copy the public folder to your current working directory.

### Github Actions

The nightly (unstable) versions of the client are also available as a github action artifacts.
