# not-th.re

!3 (spoken not three, derived from the leet speak word not3) is a simple
paste sharing platform similar to other solutions like hastebin or pastebin.

!3 is focused on simplicity, security by client side encryption
and usage of the monaco editor.

## Features

- Simple paste sharing
- Client side encryption
- Monaco editor
- Syntax highlighting
- Dark mode
- No cookies
- No tracking
- No ads

## Usage

The simplest way to use !3 is to visit our hosted instance at [https://not-th.re](https://not-th.re).

If you want to host your own instance, you can use this minimal docker compose example:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14.5
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: db
      POSTGRES_USER: db
      POSTGRES_DB: db
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/main:latest
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      DB_HOST: postgres

volumes:
  db:
```

If you plan on only using it alone or with a very small group of people, you can also use sqlite:


```yml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/not-three/main:latest
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      USE_SQLITE: "true"
      SQLITE_FILENAME: /data/db.sqlite
    volumes:
      - db:/data

volumes:
  db:
```

The sqlite mode is not recommended but is useful for development,
or deployments to raspberry pi's or other small devices (we do support arm64).

For a more advanced deployment, see the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.

## Static site deployment

In some scenarios, you might want to deploy the static site without a backend,
for example [not-th.re](https://not-th.re) is deployed with Cloudflare Pages,
while the API is hosted on [api.not-th.re](https://api.not-th.re).

The static site can then be configured by editing the `config.json` file.

```json
{ "baseURL": "https://api.not-th.re/", "terms": "https://scolasti.co/go/privacy" }
```

This is possible by getting the static fils by one of the following ways.

### Docker way

The docker way does ensure you get the exact same files as for the api deployment.

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh -v $(pwd):/mnt ghcr.io/not-three/main:latest -c "cp -r /app/client/ /mnt/client/"
```

This will copy the client folder to your current working directory.
If you use a specific api version, you can replace `latest` with the version you want to use.

### Github Actions

The latest version of the client is also available as a zip file in the workflow section of this repository.

```
